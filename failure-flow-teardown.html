<!-- ========= HERO ========= -->
<section id="hero">
  <h1>Failure Flow Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    An examination of subscription payment failure scenarios and their impact on user experience.
  </p>

  <ul class="meta">
    <li>UX Analysis</li>
    <li>Failure States</li>
    <li>User Experience</li>
    <li>Design Considerations</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= CONTEXT ========= -->
<section id="context">
  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    This analysis explores common subscription payment failure scenarios, focusing on how interface design can support user understanding and trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a payment fails, users need clear information about what happened, what to do next, and the status of their money.
  </p>

  <div class="insight">
    <strong>Scope:</strong>
    This analysis evaluates user interface behavior and communication during payment failures.
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ========= WHY FAILURE ========= -->
<section id="why-failure">
  <h2>Why Failure Scenarios Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Payment failures are high-stress moments for users. Unclear or missing information can lead to confusion, repeated errors, and loss of trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users need to know:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether the payment was processed</li>
    <li>What caused the failure</li>
    <li>What they should do next</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= FAILURE ASSUMPTIONS ========= -->
<section id="failure-assumptions">
  <h2>Failure Scenario Assumptions</h2>
  <p>
    The following assumptions guided the analysis of failure states:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Network issues are common during mobile payments</li>
    <li>Users are concerned about double charges</li>
    <li>Unclear error messages increase user anxiety</li>
    <li>Silent failures are often interpreted as system unreliability</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="insight">
    These assumptions helped prioritize which failure scenarios to address and how to design recovery options.
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ========= CASE 1 ========= -->
<section id="network-error">
  <h2>Case 1: Network Error During Payment</h2>

  <h3>Scenario</h3>
  <p>
    The user starts a payment, but the network connection is lost or slow while the transaction is processing.
  </p>

  <h3>User Concerns</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Was the payment completed?</li>
    <li>Was money deducted from my account?</li>
    <li>Should I retry the payment?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common UI Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Generic error messages (e.g., "Something went wrong")</li>
    <li>No confirmation of payment status</li>
    <li>Only a "Retry" button, without explanation</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="insight">
    <strong>Risk:</strong>
    Ambiguous messages can lead to repeated attempts and increased user frustration.
  </div>

  <h3>Improved UX Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly state whether the payment was completed or not</li>
    <li>Explain the cause in simple terms</li>
    <li>Provide options: retry, check status, or exit safely</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= CASE 2 ========= -->
<section id="back-action">
  <h2>Case 2: User Presses Back During Processing</h2>

  <p>
    Users may press the back button due to hesitation, impatience, or accidental input while the payment is processing.
  </p>

  <h3>User Uncertainty</h3>
  <p>
    The user is left unsure about the status of the transaction: was it cancelled, delayed, or completed in the background?
  </p>

  <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevent accidental exits during critical actions</li>
    <li>If exit is allowed, explain the consequences clearly</li>
    <li>Confirm the payment outcome explicitly after any interruption</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= CASE 3 ========= -->
<section id="low-balance">
  <h2>Case 3: Insufficient Balance</h2>

  <p>
    The user attempts a payment, but the available balance is lower than the required amount.
  </p>

  <h3>Common UI Issues</h3>
  <p>
    Generic or unclear error messages that do not explain the issue or offer alternatives.
  </p>

  <h3>Improved UX Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use clear language: "Insufficient balance for this transaction"</li>
    <li>Avoid blame or judgmental tone</li>
    <li>Offer alternatives: try again later, use a different payment method</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= RESPONSIBILITY ========= -->
<section id="responsibility">
  <h2>Communication and Responsibility</h2>

  <p>
    The way a system communicates during failures affects user trust.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Network issues: Acknowledge shared responsibility</li>
    <li>System errors: Take ownership and explain next steps</li>
    <li>Payment mismatches: Provide clear, actionable information</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="insight">
    Clear communication and accountability help users feel supported, even when things go wrong.
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ========= COGNITIVE LOAD ========= -->
<section id="cognitive-load">
  <h2>Reducing User Cognitive Load</h2>

  <p>
    During payment failures, users are already under stress. The interface should minimize confusion and provide clear guidance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Explain what happened in simple, non-technical language</li>
    <li>Avoid blank or ambiguous screens</li>
    <li>State the payment and refund status clearly</li>
    <li>Offer options, not just forced actions</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= DESIGN PRINCIPLES ========= -->
<section id="failure-principles">
  <h2>Design Principles for Failure States</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Prioritize clarity and visibility of system status</li>
    <li>Provide explicit reassurance and next steps</li>
    <li>Focus on user protection and trust</li>
    <li>Use familiar, consistent language and patterns</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= CONCLUSION ========= -->
<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Payment failures are critical moments for user experience. Systems that communicate clearly, take responsibility, and guide users through recovery are more likely to maintain trust and usability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designing for failure states is not just about error handling—it’s about supporting users when they need it most.
