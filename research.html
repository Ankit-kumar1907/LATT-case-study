  <h1>Research & Design Reasoning</h1>
  <p>
    This document details the research thinking, assumptions, constraints,
    and evaluative reasoning behind the Latt project.  
    It complements the main case study by focusing on *why* decisions were made,
    not *what* was built.
  </p>

</section>

<!-- ========= RESEARCH QUESTION ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Research Question</h2>
  <p>
    How can users maintain awareness and control over recurring digital
    subscriptions without increasing cognitive load or compromising trust
    during sensitive financial moments?
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Scope & Method</h2>

  <p>
    This project used analytical and comparative research methods rather
    than primary user interviews. Existing subscription products were
    examined to identify recurring friction points, failure patterns,
    and trust breakdowns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal was not to measure frequency, but to understand mechanisms:
    how and why users lose awareness and confidence over time.
  </p>
</section>


<!-- ========= ASSUMPTIONS ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Assumptions & Unknowns</h2>

  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Users forget subscriptions primarily due to cognitive overload, not negligence</li>
    <li>Recurring payments create passive financial loss over time</li>
    <li>Trust is fragile in financial products, especially during onboarding</li>
    <li>Users prefer familiar interaction patterns over novel ones</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Open Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What level of transparency is sufficient to build trust?</li>
    <li>How much subscription detail is helpful before it becomes overwhelming?</li>
    <li>Will users allow limited email scanning if value is shown first?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= USER MODEL ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>User Mental Model</h2>

  <p>
    Users do not think of subscriptions as active commitments.
    Instead, they experience them as background processes that fade from attention
    once initial value is obtained.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Know what I’m paying for</li>
    <li><strong>Constraint:</strong> Limited time and attention</li>
    <li><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> Forget → passive loss</li>
    <li><strong>Recovery Need:</strong> Visibility + easy exit</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= TRUST ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Trust, Privacy & Ethics</h2>

  <p>
    Financial data access is a high-anxiety interaction. Users are skeptical of
    applications that request permissions before demonstrating clear value.
  </p>

  <div class="insight">
    <strong>Design Position:</strong>
    Trust must be earned progressively, not demanded upfront.
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Value explanation before permission requests</li>
    <li>Clear justification for each data access</li>
    <li>User control over when and how data is used</li>
    <li>No hidden background processes</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= IA ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Information Architecture Rationale</h2>

  <p>
    The primary interface emphasizes subscription visibility rather than features.
    Users should immediately understand their financial exposure without navigation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dashboard prioritizes active subscriptions</li>
    <li>Alerts are contextual, not constant</li>
    <li>Discovery is secondary to management</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= INTERACTION ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Interaction Principles</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Familiar patterns reduce cognitive effort</li>
    <li>Destructive actions must be visually distinct</li>
    <li>No irreversible actions without confirmation</li>
    <li>Errors must be explainable and recoverable</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= ALTERNATIVES ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Alternative Approaches Considered</h2>

  <h3>Full Bank Integration</h3>
  <p>
    Rejected due to high trust barriers and fear of misuse.
  </p>

  <h3>Fully Manual Subscription Entry</h3>
  <p>
    Rejected because it relies on memory — the same failure point the product
    aims to address.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ========= EVALUATION ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Evaluation Plan</h2>

  <p>
    The design would be evaluated through usability testing focused on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Time to identify active subscriptions</li>
    <li>Clarity during failure and error states</li>
    <li>User confidence during cancellation</li>
    <li>Error recovery without external help</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<p>
  These assumptions were treated as hypotheses and directly informed
  interface prioritization, failure handling, and onboarding flow design.
</p>


<!-- ========= LEARNINGS ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Learnings</h2>

  <p>
    This project reinforced that trust and clarity matter most when systems fail.
    Designing for uncertainty leads to calmer, more reliable user experiences.
