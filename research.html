<section>
  <h1>Research & Design Reasoning</h1>
  <p>
    This document outlines the research assumptions, constraints, and evaluative reasoning behind the Latt project.
    It focuses on the rationale for design decisions, rather than the final output.
  </p>

</section>

<!-- ========= RESEARCH QUESTION ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Research Focus</h2>
  <p>
    How can users maintain awareness and control over recurring digital subscriptions,
    while minimizing cognitive load and supporting trust during financial interactions?
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ========= SCOPE & METHOD ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Scope & Approach</h2>
  <p>
    This project used comparative analysis of existing subscription products to identify common friction points,
    failure patterns, and trust issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal was to understand how and why users lose awareness and confidence in managing subscriptions over time.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ========= ASSUMPTIONS ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Key Assumptions & Open Questions</h2>

  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Users lose track of subscriptions due to cognitive overload, not lack of interest</li>
    <li>Recurring payments can lead to passive financial loss if not monitored</li>
    <li>Trust in financial products is fragile, especially during onboarding and failure states</li>
    <li>Familiar interaction patterns reduce hesitation and errors</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Open Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What level of transparency is needed to build and maintain user trust?</li>
    <li>How much subscription detail is helpful before it becomes overwhelming?</li>
    <li>Would users be comfortable with limited email scanning if value is demonstrated first?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= USER MODEL ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>User Mental Model</h2>
  <p>
    Users typically do not think of subscriptions as ongoing commitments.
    Instead, they experience them as background processes that fade from attention once the initial value is obtained.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Understand what they are paying for</li>
    <li><strong>Constraint:</strong> Limited time and attention</li>
    <li><strong>Failure Mode:</strong> Forgetting → passive financial loss</li>
    <li><strong>Recovery Need:</strong> Visibility and easy management</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= TRUST & ETHICS ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Trust, Privacy & Ethical Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Financial data access is a high-anxiety interaction.
    Users are skeptical of applications that request permissions before demonstrating clear value.
  </p>

  <div class="insight">
    <strong>Design Principle:</strong>
    Trust is built progressively through transparency and user control.
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Explain value before requesting permissions</li>
    <li>Provide clear justification for each data access</li>
    <li>Give users control over when and how their data is used</li>
    <li>Avoid hidden or automatic background processes</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Information Architecture Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    The interface prioritizes subscription visibility and clarity over feature discovery.
    Users should immediately understand their financial commitments without unnecessary navigation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dashboard focuses on active subscriptions and upcoming payments</li>
    <li>Alerts are contextual and actionable</li>
    <li>Subscription management is the primary function; discovery is secondary</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= INTERACTION PRINCIPLES ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Interaction Design Principles</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Use familiar patterns to reduce cognitive effort</li>
    <li>Make destructive actions (e.g., cancellation) visually distinct and confirm before execution</li>
    <li>Ensure all errors are explainable and recoverable</li>
    <li>Provide clear next steps during and after failure states</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= ALTERNATIVES ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Alternative Approaches Considered</h2>

  <h3>Full Bank Integration</h3>
  <p>
    Not pursued due to high trust barriers and user concerns about data misuse.
  </p>

  <h3>Manual Subscription Entry</h3>
  <p>
    Not pursued because it relies on user memory, which is the same failure point the project aims to address.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ========= EVALUATION ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Evaluation Plan</h2>
  <p>
    The design would be evaluated through usability testing, focusing on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Time and ease of identifying active subscriptions</li>
    <li>Clarity and recoverability during failure and error states</li>
    <li>User confidence in managing or cancelling subscriptions</li>
    <li>Ability to recover from errors without external assistance</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ========= SUMMARY ========= -->
<section>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project emphasized that trust and clarity are most critical during moments of uncertainty or failure.
    Designing for these scenarios leads to more reliable and user-friendly experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    The assumptions and principles outlined here directly informed interface prioritization, failure handling, and onboarding design.
